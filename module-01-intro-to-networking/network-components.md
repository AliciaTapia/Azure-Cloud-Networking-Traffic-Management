# Network Components: WAN, LAN, Host, and Server

Understanding the basic components of a network is essential for grasping how data flows and systems communicate. Below are key concepts explained with examples.

---

## üåê Wide Area Network (WAN)

- **Definition**: A WAN is a network that spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple smaller networks (LANs).
- **Purpose**: Enables communication between distant locations.
- **Examples**:
  - The Internet
  - A corporate network connecting offices in different cities or countries
- **Characteristics**:
  - Slower speeds compared to LANs
  - Higher latency
  - Often uses leased telecommunication lines

## üè† Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Definition**: A LAN is a network confined to a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or building.
- **Purpose**: Facilitates high-speed communication between devices in close proximity.
- **Examples**:
  - Office network connecting computers and printers
  - Home Wi-Fi network
- **Characteristics**:
  - High speed and low latency
  - Typically owned and managed by a single organization

## üíª Host

- **Definition**: A host is any device connected to a network that can send or receive data.
- **Examples**:
  - Desktop computers
  - Smartphones
  - IoT devices
- **Characteristics**:
  - Each host has a unique IP address
  - Can act as a client or server

## üñ•Ô∏è Server

- **Definition**: A server is a specialized host that provides services or resources to other devices (clients) on the network.
- **Examples**:
  - Web server hosting a website
  - File server storing shared documents
  - Database server managing data for applications
- **Characteristics**:
  - Always-on and highly available
  - Often more powerful than client devices
  - Can serve multiple clients simultaneously
