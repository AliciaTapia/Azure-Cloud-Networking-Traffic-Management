# Network Types

This document provides an overview of various network types used in computer networking, including traditional classifications and Azure-specific implementations.

---

## 1. Local Area Network (LAN)

- **Definition**: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area such as a home, school, or office building.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High data transfer rates
  - Low latency
  - Typically owned and managed by a single organization
- **Use Cases**:
  - Office networks
  - School computer labs
- **Examples**:
  - Ethernet-based LAN in a corporate office

---

## 2. Wide Area Network (WAN)

- **Definition**: A WAN spans a large geographical area and connects multiple LANs.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Lower data transfer rates compared to LANs
  - Often uses leased telecommunication lines
- **Use Cases**:
  - Connecting branch offices across cities or countries
- **Examples**:
  - The Internet
  - Corporate WAN connecting global offices

---

## 3. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- **Definition**: A MAN covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN, typically a city or campus.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High-speed connectivity
  - Managed by a single entity or consortium
- **Use Cases**:
  - City-wide Wi-Fi networks
  - University campus networks
- **Examples**:
  - Cable TV networks
  - City government networks

---

## 4. Personal Area Network (PAN)

- **Definition**: A PAN is a small network used for communication among personal devices.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Short-range connectivity
  - Often wireless
- **Use Cases**:
  - Connecting smartphones, tablets, and laptops
- **Examples**:
  - Bluetooth connections
  - USB-based device networks

---

## 5. Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)

- **Definition**: A WLAN is a LAN that uses wireless communication.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Uses Wi-Fi standards (IEEE 802.11)
  - Flexible and mobile connectivity
- **Use Cases**:
  - Home and office wireless networks
- **Examples**:
  - Wi-Fi networks in coffee shops
  - Wireless routers in homes

---

## 6. Storage Area Network (SAN)

- **Definition**: A SAN is a specialized network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High-speed data transfer
  - Dedicated to storage traffic
- **Use Cases**:
  - Data centers
  - Enterprise backup systems
- **Examples**:
  - Fibre Channel SAN
  - iSCSI SAN

---

## 7. Campus Area Network (CAN)

- **Definition**: A CAN connects multiple LANs within a limited geographical area such as a university or business campus.
- **Characteristics**:
  - High-speed backbone
  - Centralized management
- **Use Cases**:
  - University campuses
  - Corporate headquarters
- **Examples**:
  - University network connecting dorms, labs, and libraries

---

## 8. Azure-Specific Network Types

### a. Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)
- **Definition**: VNets are the fundamental building blocks for private networking in Azure.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Secure communication between Azure resources
  - Supports IPv4 and IPv6 (dual stack)
  - Subnets must be /64 for IPv6
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hosting virtual machines
  - Isolating workloads
- **Examples**:
  - VNet with multiple subnets for web and database tiers

### b. Hybrid Networks
- **Definition**: Hybrid networks connect Azure resources with on-premises infrastructure.
- **Key Services**:
  - **Azure VPN Gateway**: Encrypted tunnel over the internet
  - **Azure ExpressRoute**: Private, dedicated connection
  - **Point-to-Site VPN**: Connects individual clients
  - **Site-to-Site VPN**: Connects on-premises VPN device to Azure
- **Use Cases**:
  - Extending on-premises networks to the cloud
  - Secure remote access
- **Examples**:
  - Connecting a corporate data center to Azure via ExpressRoute

### c. Cloud-Only Networks
- **Definition**: Azure VNets without any direct connection to on-premises networks.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fully cloud-based
  - Isolated from external networks
- **Use Cases**:
  - Cloud-native applications
  - Development and testing environments
- **Examples**:
  - VNet hosting a web app and database with no external access
