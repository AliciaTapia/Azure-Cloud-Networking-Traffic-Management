# Activity 4: Network Topologies, Architectures, and Traffic Flows

## 🎯 Objective
Learn about different ways computers can be connected together (topologies), how networks are built (architectures), and how data moves around (traffic flows). This activity uses simple examples that a 15-year-old can understand.

## 📊 Network Topologies

### 1. Mesh
**Example:** Imagine every student in a classroom can talk directly to every other student.  
**Use:** Good for reliability, but lots of connections.

### 2. Hybrid
**Example:** A school uses both wired and wireless connections.  
**Use:** Combines different topologies for flexibility.

### 3. Star / Hub-and-Spoke
**Example:** All students talk to the teacher, and the teacher passes messages.  
**Use:** Easy to manage, but if the teacher (hub) fails, communication stops.

### 4. Spine and Leaf
**Example:** In a school network, spine switches connect to leaf switches that connect to computers.  
**Use:** Used in data centers for fast communication.

### 5. Point-to-Point
**Example:** Two computers connected directly with a cable.  
**Use:** Simple and fast for small setups.

## 🏫 Network Architectures

### Three-Tier Hierarchical Model

- **Core Layer:** Like the school’s main internet connection.
- **Distribution Layer:** Like the hallway switches that connect classrooms.
- **Access Layer:** Like the computers in each classroom.

**Why it matters:** Helps organize big networks so they work smoothly.

## 🔄 Traffic Flows

### North-South
**Example:** A student sends homework to the cloud (internet).  
**Direction:** From inside the network to outside.

### East-West
**Example:** Students share files with each other in the classroom.  
**Direction:** Inside the same network.
